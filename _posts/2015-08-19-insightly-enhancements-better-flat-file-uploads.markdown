We've added Contact/Organization Owner, Opportunity History, Emails, and a couple of pre-combined Activity and Party sources to our Insightly connection.<!--more--> These new fields and sources should help you better capture the full spectrum of your sales team's activity and keep improving your sales performance metrics.We've also improved our flat file upload process to let you easily bulk configure fields from a single page. If you're uploading a spreadsheet with 100+ columns, the new process should be much easier.
