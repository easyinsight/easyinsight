You can now customize dashboard report headers in a few new ways!<!--more-->

The easiest way is to go to your Account Skin page (username in the upper right -> Account Settings -> Account Skin).

Here, under the Dashboard Styling section, you'll find new options for Report Title Font Size, Report Title Font Bold, and Report Title Border Color.

You can use these in combination with the options above for Report Title Background Color and Report Title Text Color to further customize the look and feel of your dashboards.
