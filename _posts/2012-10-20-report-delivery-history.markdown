You can now pull up the history of a report or multiple report delivery by opening up the delivery configuration on the Scheduling page (click the Edit icon) and clicking on the History button.<!--more--> This history includes the success or failure of deliveries with whatever email bounce/email drop information is available to us, making it easier to track down why someone might not be receiving the reports they should be.
