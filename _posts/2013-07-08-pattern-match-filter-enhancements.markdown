Pattern match filters now include a text entry box on the end user view.<!--more--> We've also added an "Auto Wild Card" setting which will change the filter to basically do a "contains" instead of searching for an exact match, equivalent to putting wildcard characters on either side of the pattern value. This is particular useful in combination with the "Report Runs Manually" option found in the general report properties.
