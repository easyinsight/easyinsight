If you want to report on the newly added "Marking Card as Done" functionality in Trello, those fields are now available in Easy Insight! <!--more-->

Trello recently added new functionality for marking a card as "Done" (<a href="http://blog.trello.com/mark-a-trello-card-as-done">http://blog.trello.com/mark-a-trello-card-as-done</a>). Your Trello connection in Easy Insight should now have two new fields. The first, Card Due Complete, is a true/false field showing whether or not the card has been marked as Done. The second, Card Due Complete At, is a date field showing when the card was marked as Done. Both fields can be found in the Cards folder. Enjoy!
