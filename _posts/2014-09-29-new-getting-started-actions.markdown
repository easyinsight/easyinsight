We've added a couple of "Getting Started" actions to the Home screens on both HTML5 and full interfaces.<!--more--> The first of these provides a quick way to set up email reports if you're new to Easy Insight. The other gives you a quick way to create a combined data source and a dashboard on top of that data source. The combined dashboard will automatically pull elements of the dashboards in the child sources to create a good starting point dashboard for your use.
