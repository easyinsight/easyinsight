We've made a few small but helpful improvements to the report editor. When you click on a date field in the report fields section, it'll now show you which date level that date is at. The menu for groupings now includes an "Exclude Empty" option to automatically create a filter excluding rows with no value. And finally, we've added a simple highlighted version of formulas in custom fields to help you better see what's going on in your calculations. Enjoy!
