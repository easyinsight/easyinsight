We've added new connections to Freshsales, Teamwork Desk, and Teamwork CRM!<!--more-->

First, we've added a connection to <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshsales-crm/">Freshsales</a>. This integration currently includes your Freshsales deals, accounts, leads, and contacts. You can use this connection to get a full view of your Freshworks data by combining Freshsales, Freshdesk, and Freshservice into a single dashboard.

We've also added an integration to <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/desk">Teamwork Desk</a>. The Teamwork Desk connection includes tickets, ticket activity history, inboxes, and customers. The Teamwork Desk prebuilt dashboard includes a variety of views to track performance across your inboxes and agents. You can consolidate your Teamwork Desk data with your other data from Teamwork Projects and Teamwork CRM.

Lastly, we've added an integration to the newly released <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/crm">Teamwork CRM</a>. The API for Teamwork CRM is still in development, but our initial connection covers deals, companies, contacts, and products.
