Sometimes, you just need to be able to apply more transformations to your data sources to get the reports you want in Easy Insight.<!--more--> You can now build a report that generates one set of values, then add it to another report as an "add-on report" through the Additional Properties section of the report editor. This functionality dramatically expands the power of your reports, while making it easy to track down calculation or filter issues at any part of the process.
