For this week, we've got improvements to diagrams, new functionality for date range filters, and new ways to style table cells in reports.<!--more-->

<h2 class="productHeader">Diagrams</h2>

You can now auto generate diagram reports instead of having to manually set up each step, helping you to easily create flow diagrams like the following:

For more information on creating diagrams, see our <a href="https://www.easy-insight.com/docs/report_types/diagram.html">diagram documentation</a>. 

<h2 class="productHeader">Date Range Filter Changes</h2>

Want to quickly change an absolute date range filter to a certain time range? You can now click on the filter label to quickly change your date filter to one of the standard rolling date ranges:

<h2 class="productHeader">Table Cell Styling</h2>

We've added a couple of new options to use in styling table cells in list, tree, summary, and form reports. You can use conditional formatting to style table cells as icons:

You can also display values as progress bars:
