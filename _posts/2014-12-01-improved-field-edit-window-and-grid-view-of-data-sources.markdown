We've made a couple of notable changes over the last week.<!--more--> First, we've made several changes to clean up the field edit/calculation definition window. It should be less busy and more obvious what to do in the different sections of the window now. We'll still be making further improvements to the window to make it as usable as possible.<br><br>We've also added a Grid view of your data sources on the Home page of the HTML5 interface. This view shows your data sources in a similar fashion to the Connections page, making it easy to see which type of connection a given data source is, as well as making it easier for you to recognize what's going on with your data sources on the Home page.
