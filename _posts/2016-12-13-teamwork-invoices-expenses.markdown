We've added Invoices and Expenses to our Teamwork connection. We've also made heat and marker maps easier to create using postal codes.<!--more-->

You can now report on Invoices and Expenses from Teamwork. You should find the new set of fields for both in your field list in the report editor.

If you're trying to build a map using postal code, you should find it easier now. When you select a heat map or marker map in the report editor, you'll be prompted to choose whether you want to use latitude/longitude or postal code/country as the fields for the report. Choose postal code/country to take advantage of the new functionality, then select your postal code field. If your data includes postal codes outside of the United States, you'll want to specify a country field as well.
