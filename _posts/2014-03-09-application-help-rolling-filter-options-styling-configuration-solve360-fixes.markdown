The Help section within the application now directs to the most recent version of the docs (which are receiving significant work as well to bring them up to date).<!--more--> Rolling date filters now include options for Last Full Quarter, Last Full Year, Previous Full Week/Month/Quarter/Year, and Last Week/Month/Quarter/Year to the Current Day.Reports now default to using the application skin you define under the Account section. For example, if you choose particular chart colors in that section, any reports you create will use those colors, and if you then change that color scheme, reports will correctly reflect those changes.
