We made a number of aesthetic improvements to the various reports as rendered in HTML5, particularly with list, chart, YTD, compare years, and vertical list reports.<!--more--> We've also added the Linked Organization to Insightly Opportunities and fixed custom contact fields on Solve360. PDF exports were also improved to maintain various configuration settings such as font size, scripting for colors, and alignments, along with miscellaneous other minor aesthetic improvements.
