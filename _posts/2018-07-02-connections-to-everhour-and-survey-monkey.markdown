We've added new connections to <a href="https://www.everhour.com">Everhour</a> and <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com">SurveyMonkey</a>!<!--more-->

The new Everhour connection enables you to combine your Everhour time data with your project management data for seamless reporting. Pull in your time tracking information and match it with your task information from Basecamp, Asana, Clickup, Teamwork, Pivotal Tracker, or Redbooth to get a full view of your project management and improve your resource allocation.

Our new SurveyMonkey connection helps you create dashboards across your surveys or combine your survey data with additional data sources like Excel sheets, CSV files, or other SaaS products to help give your customers a full, rich visual display of all of their data.
