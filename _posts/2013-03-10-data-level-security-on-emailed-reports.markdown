Have multiple users who should be receiving a slight variant of a few different reports? Now, you can simply set up data level security through the Personas section of your account to filter a certain user to only being able to see data matched to a particular Responsible Party, set of Projects, or anything else.<!--more--> From there, as you assign them to scheduled email reports, it'll automatically adjust the contents based on those filters for each email it sends out.
