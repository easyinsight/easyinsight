We've added the ability to make customizable, styleable labels always display on Column, Bar, Stacked Column, Stacked Bar, and Bubble charts.<!--more--> You can configure this display through Additional Configuration -> Report Properties. In particular, the Bubble chart label is still a bit of a work in progress, but we felt that it reflects enough improvement by itself to justify an earlier release.
