We've improved the report type selector so that you can more easily see the different types of reports available to you in Easy Insight.<!--more-->

When you click on the report type selection button in the report editor, you'll get a new window to help you pick your report type:

You should be able to quickly see the various types of reports available to you instead of having to click through different sections.
