We've reworked our PDF and PNG report exports to make them look just like they do on the browser.<!--more--> These enhancements should make your charts, diagrams, and maps all render into gorgeous documents for sharing with the rest of your team. You can also now include report PNGs inline as part of your scheduled emails.<br><br>

You can make it easier and faster for your end users to find their reports in Easy Insight by setting the new "Only Show Top Reports and Dashboards" option on their configuration under User Administration. With this new option, users will only be shown the list of Top Reports and Dashboards on their Home page.

Renaming and manipulating different tabs in the dashboard editor should be much easier now with recent changes as well. Simply click on the tab dropdown in the editor to rename a particular tab.
