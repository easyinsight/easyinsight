You can now set up absolute and range date filters to use a rolling date range so that as the date changes, the default dates on those filters change.<!--more-->

Click on the filter name of one of your absolute or range filters in the report editor and choose "Edit Filter". from the Edit Filter window, you can choose a rolling window with the same sort of options as you'd use with normal rolling filters. Once set, the filter will default to this range when loaded in the end user or dashboard views.
