From the report editor, you can now click directly into drillthroughs. We've also added direct links to the documentation from functions in the field editor.<!--more-->

Instead of having to go from the editor into the end user view to click into a drillthrough report or dashboard, you can now click directly from values in the report editor.

From the field editor, you can now click directly over into function documentation. From the tree of available functions, you can click on the "Docs" link to the far right next to the function to jump over for an explanation of the function and examples of usage.
