Working with a data set that you aren't totally familiar with? You can now toggle the Data Discovery screen in the report editor through Quick Actions -> Toggle Report Editor Sections -> Show Data Discovery.<!--more--> From this screen, you can search to find any field containing a certain value. For example, if you aren't sure which field contains your SKU value, you could search on a particular SKU value to find the appropriate field.We've also made several usability improvements to filters. In particular, range filters should be easier to use now when you define a filter on measures, and year/quarter of year/month range filters should be dramatically easier to use.
