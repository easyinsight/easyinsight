Want to customize the filters used when sending out a report email? We've added functionality to let you customize filters as part of email setup. We also have recordings from the four webinars we did last month.<!--more-->

Have one report that you want to send out with a different date range, set of assignees, or other variant in filter from the original report? You can now customize the filters on email configuration to avoid creating numerous copies of reports.

When setting up the scheduled email, you can click on Customize Filters as part of the Report and Format step:

On selecting Customize Filters, the various report or dashboard filters will be loaded for you to customize. If you don't customize a particular filter, it'll remain with the report's default settings.

Once customized, you can do the rest of your email configuration as normal. When the email is sent, it'll apply those custom filters.
