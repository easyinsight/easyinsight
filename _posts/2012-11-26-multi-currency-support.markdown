We now support multi currencies in a single report! As an example, you can combine multiple Highrise deals in different currencies into a single total deal value with the appropriate conversions.<!--more--> From the field editor on your currency measure, choose the appropriate Currency Code field and it will automatically convert the end result value into whatever currency is specified on your Account Settings.
