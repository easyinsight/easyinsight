We've added new functionality around emailing dashboards as PNGs!<!--more-->

You can now schedule dashboards to be emailed as PNG or inline PNG, giving you an additional option beyond sending as PDF. Just add your dashboard to the email configuration as you normally would, then click on the dashboard name to customize configuration:

You can using configuration options to customize the width/height of the dashboard image, select certain tabs to include in the email, and show or hide the filters on the dashboard in the image:
