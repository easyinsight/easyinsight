Want a consistent color applied across your reports for a particular sales rep, project, or any other field in your data sources? You can now create lookup tables specifying a color as opposed to a value.<!--more-->

Start by clicking on Create Lookup Table on the data source you want to use. Choose "Color" as the lookup table type and choose the field you want to assign colors to. From there, you can assign colors per possible values of that field. And once done, it'll automatically apply those colors across all reports, helping you to easily apply consistent colors across your tables and charts!
