We've rolled out a new connection to <a href="https://www.clickup.com">ClickUp</a> to help you extend your project management reporting. 

This connection includes prebuilt reports around workload, completed work, and more in a variety of tables and charts. Beyond the prebuilt reports, you can create your own rich custom reports on your ClickUp data as well.

You can check out a quick video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An0wYqTatYc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An0wYqTatYc</a> to give you an introduction to Easy Insight and ClickUp. Enjoy!
