Looking to polish the appearance of your dashboards? We've added a few new options with dashboard tab styles, pulling page filters up to the top of the dashboard, showing help sections for each report on the dashboard, and font family customization.<!--more-->

We've added a new option for customizing the appearance of your dashboard tabs. The setting is available at an account level under your Account Skin page as the first option below Dashboard Styling:

<img style="max-width:300px" src="/images/dashboard_tab_styling.png" alt="Dashboard Tab Styling" class="img img-responsive"/>

Once you've changed from the default Buttons to Tabs, you'll see your dashboard page style change to something along the lines of the following image:

<img style="max-width:700px" src="/images/dashboard_tabs.png" alt="Dashboard Tabs" class="img img-responsive"/>

The next new option is "Pull Filters Up", which can be found through the dashboard editor under Configuration -> Dashboard Properties. Normally, when you have page level filters on a dashboard, they appear as their own section of filters separate from dashboard level filters, as shown in the following screenshot:

<img style="max-width:700px" src="/images/default_filters.png" alt="Default Dashboard Filters" class="img img-responsive"/>

Enabling the "Pull Filters Up" consolidates filters and pulls the page filters up to the dashboard filter level, presenting your users with a single cohesive set of filters:

<img style="max-width:700px" src="/images/consolidated_filters.png" alt="Consolidated Dashboard Filters" class="img img-responsive"/>

You'll also see the "Show report descriptions if available as Help sections" as another option in Dashboard Properties. If enabled, this setting will display a Help icon next to report titles if a description is defined for the report. Clicking on the Help icon will display the report description as shown:

<img style="max-width:700px" src="/images/report_help_on_dashboard.png" alt="Report Help on Dashboard" class="img img-responsive"/>

Finally, we've implemented Custom Font Family functionality for dashboards and individual reports. You can choose from different fonts found under Dashboard Options and Report Formatting to customize the font used. For example, a dashboard customized to Lato is shown below:

<img style="max-width:900px" src="/images/lato_dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard with Lato" class="img img-responsive"/>
