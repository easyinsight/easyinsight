We've made numerous fixes to the formatting of HTML5 charts to try and deal with labels overlapping or going off the chart and fixes to deal with several IE9 specific bugs in the HTML5 UI.<!--more--> We've also gotten a significant amount of new documentation in place (with much more coming). You can find the new docs through the Documentation page on the website or the Help section of the Easy Insight application.
