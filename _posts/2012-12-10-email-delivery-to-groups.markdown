We've added a way to greatly simplify your email delivery setup.<!--more--> You can now add Groups (defined under the Account page) as recipients to report deliveries. It'll automatically send the email to everyone in the specified Group, making it much easier to deal with scheduling configuration as you add and remove users to and from Easy Insight.
