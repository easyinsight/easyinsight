We've got a couple of quick additions to Asana and Pivotal Tracker for this week!<!--more-->

First, you can now pull over <a href="https://asana.com/guide/team/advanced/status-updates-progress">Project Updates</a> from Asana. You'll find your project updates underneath the Project Updates folder in your Asana data source.

If you want to just show the last project update for a given project, you can create a newest value filter. Create a filter on the Update Created At field, click on 'Advanced Date Filters', and choose 'Newest Date'.

We've also added <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/reviews/">Reviews</a> to our Pivotal Tracker connection. You'll find reviews in the Review folder on your Pivotal Tracker data source.

It's not there quite yet, but we're working to get real time and two way functionality going on both of these connections as well. We'll post an update about that as soon as they're available!
