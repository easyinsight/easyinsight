We've added a new navigation sidebar to make it easier to navigate your way through Easy Insight.<!--more-->

You can open up the side bar by clicking on the + found to the left of the Home link:

<img style="max-width:300px;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px" src="/images/collapsed_sidebar.png" alt="Collapsed Sidebar" class="img img-responsive"/>

Once opened, you can quickly click into your recently used data sources, your top reports and dashboards, and your recent actions.

<img style="max-width:300px;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px" src="/images/opened_sidebar.png" alt="Expanded Sidebar" class="img img-responsive"/>

These links should help you get around Easy Insight. We'll have much more coming this month!
