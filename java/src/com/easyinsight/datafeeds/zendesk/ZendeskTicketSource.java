I've attached the error, but you can also see it live here:\nhttp://50.57.121.227:8080/eidbconnection\n\nI tried restarting the Tomcat server, and still got the same error. It\nlooks like there is an error in the DataConnection Class. Is there a known\nissue with this, perhaps with Tomcat 7? Let me know how we can further\ntroubleshoot this and come up with a solution. I've CC'd Steven who setup\nthe Easy Insight account incase you need any additional information on that\nfront.\n\nCheers,\nBrian Shaffer\n(716) 472-1337","priority":"high","status":"closed","recipient":"support@easyinsight.zendesk.com","requester_id":286840151,"submitter_id":286840151,"assignee_id":278230678,"organization_id":null,"group_id":118982,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[{"id":21720687,"value":""}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":21720687,"value":""}],"followup_ids":[110]},{"url":"https://easyinsight.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/87.json","id":87,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"zane@entrepreneurpartnerships.com","name":"Zane Tootell"},"to":{"address":"support@easyinsight.zendesk.com","name":"Easy Insight"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2012-11-05T02:23:33Z","updated_at":"2013-01-25T18:14:41Z","type":"question","subject":"filtering duplicate data","description":"Hi\n\nI managed to get my conversions and other calcs sorted.

Correct?\n\n\"Since your relational database is hopefully running within your enterprise\nrather than as something Software-as-a-Service accessible, you'll need to\ndownload a client application to pull that data out into Easy Insight. The\nclient is a Java web application which can be run in any application server\nor servlet container. No setup is required--just drop it into the server\nand go!\"\nThank you,\n\nBev Fay\n303.618.9302\nBeverly.Fay@gmail.com","priority":null,"status":"new","recipient":"support@easyinsight.zendesk.com","requester_id":348477631,"submitter_id":348477631,"assignee_id":null,"organization_id":null,"group_id":118982,"collaborator_ids":[],"forum_topic_id":null,"problem_id":null,"has_incidents":false,"due_at":null,"tags":[],"custom_fields":[{"id":21720687,"value":null}],"satisfaction_rating":null,"sharing_agreement_ids":[],"fields":[{"id":21720687,"value":null}]},{"url":"https://easyinsight.zendesk.com/api/v2/tickets/184.json","id":184,"external_id":null,"via":{"channel":"email","source":{"from":{"address":"andrea@monkee-boy.com","name":"Andrea Tucker"},"to":{"address":"support@easyinsight.zendesk.com","name":"Easy Insight"},"rel":null}},"created_at":"2013-02-14T16:16:31Z","updated_at":"2013-03-09T03:00:56Z","type":"problem","subject":"Sum adding up incorrectly","description":"Hello,\n\nI'm using Easy Insight on the free trial with Freshbooks data and I noticed\nwhen I use cross-tab or lists with a sum, the sum data is adding up\nincorrectly.
