                <p style="font-size:12px;">Easy Insight has proven to be a hugely powerful
                    system for us. Coupled with the incredibly fast and attentive support, it has enabled ChannelCreator to
                    automate 90% of its reporting function and focus on our strength, selling our product.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size:16px">Two More New Report Types</h2>

            <p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left">We've added three new types of reports over the course of the last couple of months--Trend, Trend Grid, and Diagram. These reports help you to create scorecard-like reports within the more user friendly context of the report editor. The Trend report provides a high level KPI display which you may find particularly useful for business user dashboards. The Trend Grid helps you to analyze the trends of a particular metric across some grouping--for example, how are my sales changing month over month by sales rep? How are my website vists changing week over week by source? And finally, the Diagram report helps you to tie together multiple KPIs into an ordered diagram which can serve as anything from a KPI tree to a business process illustration.</p>
