                <h2 style="font-size:16px">Connection to New Version of Basecamp</h2>

                <p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left">We've added a connection to the new version of Basecamp and renamed the old connection to be the connection to Basecamp Classic. At the moment, this new connection provides reporting on Projects, Todos, People, and Calendars. We've added a basic set of prebuilt reports showing todo status by project, with drillthroughs into an interactive chart and a more detailed todo list.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size:16px">Batchbook Improvements</h2>

            <p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left">We've made several long awaited improvements to our Batchbook connection. Super Tags are now pulled into Easy Insight, making it possible to report on your various custom Batchbook fields. We also now pull in Communication Parties, enabling you to tie Communications back to the related parties.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size:16px;">FreshBooks Improvements</h2>

            <p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left">In view of the performance problems encountered by some users with significant amounts of FreshBooks data, we've added the option to cache your FreshBooks data inside of Easy Insight, as is done with most of the other connections such as Basecamp and Highrise. You should find that this caching dramatically improves the performance of your FreshBooks reporting in Easy Insight.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size:16px;">Constant Contact Improvements</h2>

                <p style="font-size:13px;text-align:left">We've made further fixes and performance improvements to our Constant Contact connection. Custom fields should correctly appear in reports again, and the overall sync time should be further reduced.</p>
