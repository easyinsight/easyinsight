            <p>The Company reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without
                notice.
                Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and
                resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes
                shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of

            <p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While the Company
                prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that the Company cannot be
                responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials.
                You
                agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>

            <h2>Account Terms</h2>

                </li>
                <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot
                    and
                    will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
                </li>
                <li>You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when
                    Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).

            </ol>

            <h2>Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>A valid credit card is required for paying accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide a
                    credit
                    card number.
                </li>
                <li>If you initially sign up for an Individual, Group, Professional, or Enterprise account, and you
                    don't
                    cancel that account within 30 days, you will be billed monthly starting on the 30th day after your
                    account was initially created. If you cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice on the
                    30th
                    day, you will not be charged.
                </li>
                <li>An upgrade from the Free plan to any paying plan will end your free trial. You will be billed for
                    your
                    first month immediately upon upgrading.
                </li>

                <li>The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds
                    or
                    credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with
                    an
                    open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.
                </li>
                <li>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall

                    or
                    state) taxes.
                </li>
                <li>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be
                    charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.
                </li>
                <li>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. The
                    Company does not accept any liability for such loss.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel
                    your
                    account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the
                    Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a
                    simple
                    no questions asked cancellation link.
                </li>

                    can
                    not be recovered once your account is cancelled.
                </li>
                <li>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take
                    effect immediately and you will not be charged again.
                </li>
                <li>The Company, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
                    any
                    and all current or future use of the Service, or any other service of the Company, for any reason at
                    any
                    time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or
                    your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account.
                    The
                    Company reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
                </li>

                    temporarily
                    or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.
                </li>
                <li>Prices of all Services, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees to the Service,
                    are
                    subject to change upon 30 days notice from us. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting
                    the
                    changes to the Easy Insight Site (www.easy-insight.com) or the Service itself.
                </li>
                <li>The Company shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change,
