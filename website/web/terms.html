                    <p>By using the easy-insight.com application (“Service”), all services of Easy Insight, LLC (“the Company”), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”).</p>

<p>The Company reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service.

   <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
