                                        We've added three new types of reports over the course of the last couple of months--Trend, Trend Grid, and Diagram. These reports help you to create scorecard-like reports within the more user friendly context of the report editor. The Trend report provides a high level KPI display which you may find particularly useful for business user dashboards. The Trend Grid helps you to analyze the trends of a particular metric across some grouping--for example, how are my sales changing month over month by sales rep? How are my website vists changing week over week by source? And finally, the Diagram report helps you to tie together multiple KPIs into an ordered diagram which can serve as anything from a KPI tree to a business process illustration.

                                        Formatting Improvements</p>

                                        One of the most frequent feature requests has been around the formatting of reports themselves. In response to these requests, we've added a variety of formatting options to the data, particularly in commonly used report types such as Lists. When you add to a List report, you'll now find a "Text" tab in the field editor. From this tab, you can change text alignment, assign a fixed width to the column, and set up word wrapping. This tab is also available for Tree reports. We're working to expand this sort of formatting capability across the other report types.
                                    </p>

                                        Aesthetic Improvements</p>

                                        We've cleaned up a lot of the general look and feel of the user interface, from the report and dashboard view pages to the reports themselves. There's more to come, but we feel that the user interface has a much more modern, professional look now than it previously did.

                                        Server Upgrades and Performance Improvements</p>

                                        To provide you with the best user experience, we recently upgraded our servers to make sure that our application stays responsive and gets you your reports as quickly as possible. With these upgrades, we should be able to handle much larger data sets, so if you ran into difficulties in the past with a particularly large amont of custom data, you might want to give it a try again. We've also made a number of performance tweaks to the code to speed up report processing times.

                                        More Prebuilt Reports</p>

                                        We're working to add more prebuilt reports to each connection to show off our new capabilities and help you get started more easily than ever. You can find new prebuilt reports on the Exchange. When you install a new connection, a certain key set of prebuilt reports will automatically be installed to your account now.
                                    </p>

                                        Reworked Home Page and Beginning to Folders</p>

                                        As part of our user interface revamp, we combined the Home and My Data pages and introduced a new page for looking at a particular data source. With this rework, there are now two folders on a given data source for your reports and dashboards. You can drag your less frequently used reports into the "Additional Views" folder to help manage a larger number of reports. The ability to add custom folders will be coming soon.

                                        We've made one significant pass of updates to our documentation as found as <a href="http://www.easy-insight.com/documentation/toc.html">http://www.easy-insight.com/documentation/toc.html</a>. We're aiming to do more still, but we at least cleaned up a lot of references to old elements in the user interface and tried to provide better explanation around many common use cases.
                                    </p>

                                        And much, much, MUCH more coming soon...</p>

                                        Our mobile application is still in development, which will provide Easy Insight reporting from your iPad, iPhone, or Android device. We're aiming to create more prebuilt reports to help you better use the system--if you have particular reports you're looking for that just aren't there, let us know and we'll see what we can come up with. We also have new connections to several other systems coming up in the next couple of months. Finally, we're working on improving our own use of 3rd party services, so expect the next newsletter to look more than a little different and our support pages to change as we get new processes and systems in place to provide you with the optimal customer experience.
