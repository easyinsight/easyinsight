Easy Insight offers an innovative business intelligence product focused around getting individuals and businesses visibility, insight, and improvement. Traditional business intelligence products require difficult installations, weeks or months of complex configuration, and slow report building within fat client interfaces. Instead, we provide a new model for business intelligence based on the Software as a Service (SaaS) concept and a rich web application interface giving users the power of desktop applications without the hassles of client deployment.</p>

<p>We see every business problem through the perspective of three primary views--Visibility, Insight, and Improvement.</p>

<p>First, the user simply needs Visibility into his or her data. Since that data can be found in a variety of sources, we offer numerous approaches to get data into Easy Insight as quickly and as easily as possible. From the simple upload of Excel spreadsheets to sophisticated real time integrations with business process management engines, we offer the tools to handle your data quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Once the data is in Easy Insight, the next step is to actually analyze the data to start finding Insight. A rich variety of report types allow many different forms of sophisticated multidmensional analysis, all easily performed through the same intuitive interface. Charts, crosstabs, maps, and much more are all available for creating visually striking data displays. Rather than adding yet another dashboard product to an already crowded market, we instead offer highly extensible mechanisms for integrating with the many already established dashboards--everything from widgets for iGoogle, Yahoo, and other common widget platforms to seamless display in enterprise portal systems.</p>

<p>Finally, all of that analysis work has to occur towards the goal of achieving strategic business Improvement. Easy Insight provides solutions around industry verticals, specific product integrations, and best practices for continuous improvement. A drag and drop solution builder allows for quick combinations of solutions to define concrete, measurable goals. We enable business users to apply proven methodologies such as Lean, Six Sigma, and Balanced Scorecard with an ease unseen to now.</p>
