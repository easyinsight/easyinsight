<h2><a name="r1">What are the main report pages?</a></h2>

<p>There are two main pages for reports, the Report View and the Report Editor. The Report View is a simplified view of
    the report. It shows the report itself, any filters, and some basic functionality for exporting the report to Excel,
    PDF, and so on. The Report Editor is a much more sophisticated screen for modifying or building new reports.</p>

<h2><a name="r2">How do I create a new report?</a></h2>

<p>You can create new reports from your Home page. If you have a single data source on your system, you'll
    automatically start off on that particular data source. If you have multiple data sources, you'll need to
    click on a particular data source from the available list. Click on the New Report button and you'll
    navigate into the report editor.</p>

<h2><a name="r3">What all is in the report editor?</a></h2>

<p>There are several basic elements to the report editor that you'll want to learn how to use.</p>

<p>First, there are several controls along the top of the screen, contained in a black bar. These controls
    enable you to close the report editor, save your report, retrieve fresh data, and several other options.</p>

<p>Next, there are a set of five tabs: Getting Started, About This Report, Data, Filters, and Export. Each tab
    contains additional report information or controls to further build out your report.</p>

<p>In the upper right corner of the report editor, there may be a gray box of Suggestions. These Suggestions are
    specific to the data source and the report you've built as is, providing helpful operations for quickly
    handling common relevant tasks. For your example, the Highrise data source has several default suggestions
    around building reports against Deals, Cases, and Tasks.</p>

<p>The report type dropdown box allows you to change the type of the report from the default List to a variety
    of other options, such as Charts, Trees, and other types. The Edit Report Properties button will pull up a
    variety of more advanced additional options useful for customizing your report.</p>

<p>Down the left side of the report editor, you'll see the list of available fields, based on your data source.
    You can open up folders if present to see more available fields.</p>

<p>Across the center of the screen, you should see one or more Drop Areas, labeled along the lines of "Drop
    Field Here." To create a report, drag fields from the left hand list into the appropriate Drop Area. You can
    also double click on fields to quickly add them to the report.</p>

<h2><a name="r4">What are these field types?</a></h2>

<p>You'll notice that fields have a basic type indicated by an icon to the left of the field in that left hand
    list. Basic field types are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Grouping
        <p>A grouping represents a value by which you'll want to group up data. For example, Customer, Deal
            Status, and Responsible Party are examples of groupings.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Measure<p>A measure represents a numeric metric which you'll want to aggregate by some mathematical operation.
        Revenue and Quantity are examples of measures. Numbers are not necessarily measures--you might have
        something like Deal ID which is a number, but does not represent a metric you'd want to sum or
        average.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>Date
        <p>A date simply represents a point in time.
        </p></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="r5">How about specifics on the top report editor elements?</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Close Editor
        <p>
            Closes the report editor and returns you to the Home page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Save
        <p>
            Saves the report.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Save As
        <p>
            Saves a copy of the report under a new name.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Refresh
        <p>
            Refreshes the data on the report. If the data source caches data on Easy Insight, you can use this button to
            refresh that cached data.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Ad Hoc Mode
        <p>
            By default, Easy Insight runs the report with each change you make in the report editor. If you have a large
            data set and/or are building a complicated report, this might get slow. If you click this button, it won't
            run the report until you manually click the Refresh button or retoggle Ad Hoc Mode.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>New Report
        <p>
            Creates a new report on the existing chosen data source.
        </p>
    </li>

<h2><a name="r7">How do I customize a field once it's in a report?</a></h2>

<p>
    Once you've added a field to a report, you can click on the ... next to the field's Drop Area to open up the Field
    Editor. Within the editor, you can take a variety of actions.
</p>

<p>
    If the field is a Grouping, you can toggle the "Group" option to avoid aggregation. You can change the field type to
    Range in order to look at data in terms of numeric ranges such 0-1000, 1000-2000, and so on.
</p>

<p>
    If the field is a Date, you can change the aggregation level of the date. For example, if you want to look at data
    by Year, Quarter, Month, or so on, you'd use this window to change that aggregation level from the typical default
    of Year - Month - Day.
</p>

<p>
    If the field is a Measure, you can change the aggregation of the measure to the following options:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sum -- Sums up the data (A + B + C). For most fields, this aggregation will be the default.</li>
    <li>Average -- Averages the data (A + B + C) / N.</li>
    <li>Min -- Calculates the minimum value of the data set.</li>
    <li>Max -- Calculates the maximum value of the data set.</li>
    <li>Count -- Calculates the number of rows in the data set.</li>
    <li>Median -- Calculates the median value of the data set.</li>
    <li>Variance -- Calculates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> of the data
        set, useful for more complex calculations.
    </li>
    <li>Rank -- Calculates the rank of each row in the data set.</li>
    <li>Percent of Total -- Calculates the percent of total for each row in the data set relative to the rest.</li>
    <li>Count Distinct -- Calculates the number of distinct entries. This option is most useful when you start with a
        Grouping (for example, Deal Name) and change it to Measure/Count Distinct, since it's then showing you the
        number of Distinct deals in your system.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can also change the formatting here from the default Number to Currency, Percentage, Interval (milliseconds),
    Interval (seconds), and Bytes. You can change the maximum and minimum displayed floating points precisions.
</p>

    the additional report-specific tabs, see <a href="reporttypes.html">Report Types Documentation</a>.
</p>

<h2><a name="r8">What are hierarchies and how do I use them?</a></h2>

<p>Hierarchies allow you to define a relationship between different groupings to enable rollup and drilldown.
    For example, you might define a hierarchy of Country -> State -> City or Industry -> Company -> Deal. You
    can define hierarchies from the report editor by clicking on the Create New Hierarchy button under the Data
    tab. From here, you'll have a list of available groupings. You can drag groupings from this list into the
    area to the right to define the hierarchy from top to bottom. You can reorder groupings within the
    hierarchy. You can also delete groupings by hitting the Delete key while you have the target level
    selected.</p>

<p>Once you've defined a hierarchy, you can use it in a report just as you use any other field. Certain reports,
    notably Trees and Tree Maps, require you to define a hierarchy. For other reports, you'll be able to drill
    through the hierarchy by right clicking or shift-left clicking on the hierarchy value and choosing Drill
    Down to navigate into the next level of the hierarchy.</p>

<h2><a name="r9">How do I link to external URLs from a report?</a></h2>
<img src="../images/docs/URLLink.jpg" style="float:left;padding:10px;" alt="Display of Reports under My Data"/>

<p>You can define links to external URLs by editing a grouping and choosing the Links tab. Click on Create a
    Link. The default option allows you to associate groupings with external URLs. Fill in a Label for the URL
    Link--this is the value that will appear when you right click on the grouping in a report. For the URL, you
    can add dynamic elements to the URL, such as query parameters, by surrounding the field name you wish to add
    to the URL with brackets. You can add multiple fields to a given URL if necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="r10">How do I tie together reports through links?</a></h2>

<p>Drillthroughs enable you to connect multiple reports within a shared context. You can define drillthroughs by
    editing a grouping and choosing the Links tab. Click on Create a Link. Change the radio option to
    Drillthrough. Fill in a label for the drillthrough--this is the value that will appear when you right click
    on the grouping in a report. Choose another report as the target report. Any filters on the target report
    will automatically populate based on filters in the source report, as well as populating on the grouping you
    drill from. For example, if you have one report showing a list of suppliers and a chart showing detailed
    information filtered by supplier, connecting the two reports through drillthrough will automatically
    populate the appropriate supplier on the target report.</p>

<h2><a name="r11">How do I automatically email out a report on a scheduled basis?</a></h2>

<p>You can set up a report to email out from Easy Insight on a scheduled basis.
    You can define report delivery through My Data -> Scheduling. Available refresh intervals are Daily,
    Weekdays (Monday -> Friday, sorry, no business calendars yet), Monday/Wednesday/Friday, Tuesday/Thursday,
    Day of Week, and Day of Month. Refresh times are defined in terms of your locale time zone, so if your
    computer is running in Eastern Standard Time, you will define the refresh in terms of Eastern Standard Time.
    Times are presented on a 24 hour clock.</p>
